  3 Body Problem is an American science fiction television series created by
  David Benioff, D. B. Weiss, and Alexander Woo. The third streaming adaptation
  of the Chinese novel series Remembrance of Earth's Past by former computer
  engineer Liu Cixin, its name comes from its first volume, The Three-Body
  Problem, named after a classical physics problem dealing with Newton's laws of
  motion and gravitation. The eight-episode first season was released on Netflix
  on March 21, 2024.


  The series centres on a diverse group of characters, mainly scientists, who encounter an extraterrestrial civilization, triggering numerous threats and profound changes for humanity. While the two earlier adaptations, the animated The Three-Body Problem in Minecraft (2014–2020) and the live-action Three-Body (2023), were entirely in the novels' original Mandarin, 3 Body Problem is primarily in English with some Mandarin. It also alters parts of the original Chinese setting to include foreign characters and locations, particularly in the United Kingdom as well as China.


  This was Benioff and Weiss' first television project since the conclusion of their series Game of Thrones (2011–2019). It received positive reviews, with praise towards its cast, ambition, and production values. The series received six Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series. In May 2024, the series was renewed for a second and third season.
